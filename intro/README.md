# What Is an Analytic Application?
An **analytic application** presents data in various forms, and lets you navigate it, and enables 
planning. Analytic applications can range from simple static dashboards, showing static numbers, 
to highly customized applications. These customized applications can contain many options for 
browsing and navigating data, changing visualizations, and navigating across multiple pages or 
areas. They can have a highly customized look-and-feel, in alignment with customer branding.

# What Is Analytics Designer?
**Analytics designer** is the functionality in SAP Analytics Cloud that allows you to create analytic 
applications. There is a dedicated design environment in SAP Analytics Cloud to create such 
applications. The term design doesn't refer specifically to the UX or UI design aspect of the 
application.
It is the entire process of creating an analytic application, which includes:
- Defining the data model
- Laying out the screen
- Configuring widgets
- Wiring it all up with the help of custom scripts

Therefore, analytics designer is another way to create analytical content in SAP Analytics Cloud

# What Can You Do with Analytic Applications That You Can’t Do with Stories?

A **story** is created in a self-service workflow and can be made up of various widgets and a lot of 
configured functionality. However, the amount of customization is limited to the foreseen 
possibilities offered in the story design time environment.

An **analytic application** typically contains some custom logic, expressed with the help of scripts. 
With analytic applications there is much more flexibility to implement custom behavior. It requires 
a higher skill level to create those.

#  What’s the Scripting Language for Analytic Applications?
The scripting language is JavaScript. Scripts are executed by the web browser JavaScript engine, 
which is available out of the box. To offer good tool support for analytic application developers, 
we add a type system on top. This is used for the tooling and for validating scripts.
